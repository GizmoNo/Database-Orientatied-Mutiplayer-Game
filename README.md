# Database-Orientatied-Mutiplayer-Game
2nd year SDV602 end of year assessment


This is my DAT602 assessment. It sevolves around me creating a muliplayer game by 2 players communication through a SQL database.

I am sorry for all the SQL I was not very good at organizing back then.

If you wish to have a look run the create tables script insert script and them all functions and procedures should 
run an any order without hassle.
